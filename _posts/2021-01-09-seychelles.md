If you are looking to clear your mind, take a break from all the fuss, a spot under a palm tree on a beach in the Seychelles _is_ the place for you.
This archipelagic island country is an absolute gem, it has some of the most beautiful beaches in the world, and it is much more relaxed than what you might have
experienced in other beach oriented vacations.

Lets start with what you need to know:

# Hotels:

While the major resorts are a bit on the pricey side (When looking for hotel we even mistakenly thought the price for a day was the price for the whole period), you'll definitely get your money's worth, with that being said - there are other great alternatives that won't
dig a hole in your wallet.

## Four Seasons:

It is built on a mountain, the plus side is that you have very nice view from your room, the downside is that unless you are an experienced hiker, walking around the place is difficult, and you’ll be climbing some steep roads, but don’t worry - the hotel also provides a service of golf cars that take you from one place to the other so you don’t really have to do all this walking.
The hotel’s beach is amazing, at the time we were there (December/January) the sea was a bit stormy, but blue and the sand was clean white. They also have a nice pool and different equipment for the sea like pedal boat etc.

## Six Senses:

We didn’t get a chance to see it with my own eyes but from the pictures it looks like a great hotel, though pricey.

## Constance Ephelia:

This is the hotel we stayed at. It was amazing, but very pricey. There was no availability for regular rooms for 2 people so we took a family villa for 4 people with our friends. The regular rooms cost around 1,500 nis per night including breakfast, the family villa cost us 4000 nis per night, so 2000 nis per couple.
The family villa was amazing, there was a private long pool with 4 chars by it, a living room, two separate sleeping rooms. There was jacuzzi and steam and hot saunas. One of the rooms had a private bath and toilet.
All in all a great room, if you’re two couples and looking for privacy maybe it’s not the best room for you as one of the couples needs to use a shared bath and toilet which are not easily reachable.

The hotel also has nice breakfast in two different places, the family villas can dine in the Northern part which is by the northern sea and is less crowded and nicer than the southern one.

> **Breakfast Tip**: you can order an eggs Benedict at the breakfast. It doesn’t look like there’s such an option and they don’t mention it anywhere but if you ask for it they will happily prepare one for you :)

The hotel spreads over a very big flat area. The hotel provides service of golf cars that take you from one place to the other. There are 5 restaurants which are rather pricy, a spa and different sport facilities like: Gym, squash room, Tennis!, volleyball by the northern sea, table tennis etc.
The northern sea has a boat house with snorkelling, peddle boat, kaiaks all included.
They even have an area with turtles and at 16 every day you can feel them!

In general we did a lot to sports on our vacation and used a lot of the options available. There’s a really nice path for running by the southern sea if you’re interested.

> **Tip**: In seychelles all the beaches are publicly accessible to everyone, so if you really like one of the beaches you don’t have to book a night at the hotel that uses it. For instance we really liked the southern beach in Constance Ephelia and on days that we didn’t spend the night there we still drove there and spent the day on the breach. You’re not allowed to enter the hotel or use its facilities like chairs of course thought and they even have a guard that makes sure of that so beware :)

## Tropical Hideaway

Because of the COVID situation in our country we had to stay a little longer, Contance Ephelia was rather pricey for us to stay further so we booked Tropical hideaway. This hotel is practically a fully blown apartment, with a big living room, a porch, two toilet rooms, a laundry room, a bedroom with a table etc.
The owners are **very** welcoming, were very helpful whenever we needed anything, and the place is kept very clean, we highly recommend staying here.
The hotel is situated 10 minutes walk from the beach. The beach was rather stormy and wasn’t as pretty as compared to the beaches in Constance Ephelia during that period.
The beach also has an open air free gym for everyone’s use and a short path for walking/running.

The area has several places for eating, like La Plage which serves things like burgers, different meat and seafood dishes, The Boat House which is a few feet away, has nice drinks and sometimes has a local band playing. While the food was more to our taste in La Plage, it was nicer to sit in the boat house, the atmosphere was very welcoming, and we felt at home.

We really liked Dolce Vita restaurant which was the only place we found with good coffee! They also served great pancakes and sweet food. The other food plates were OK, not more. Also turns out Dolce Vita is actually a network of restaurants and there’s also a bigger Dolce Vita in Victoria.

There was another place called the Wooden House Cafe - house which looked very nice, but unfortunately was almost always closed during that time. We managed to go there once, the food was mostly Italian and the pasta we ordered was great, we would have definitely return, unfortunately - we didn’t see it open again, probably because of COVID.

# COVID

At the time we can around December 2020 Seychelles almost didn’t have any cases. Everyone who wished to enter had to take a test, British visitors also had to stay in quarantine for 10 days before they could travel. Most of the people didn’t use masks, except for the people who worked on the hotels which were very careful.
Around end of December we heard about a taxi driver who was sick and intected around 60 people. That day there were 40 cases after few weeks with no cases at all. The government took it very carefully and shut down all the places, including the restaurant so yes we didn’t have anywhere to eat except for few places that were open like the great Dolce Vita. All people also started wearing masks again and being careful.

What to do if you need to extend the trip
We heard there were several people that didn’t do anything and could exist the country with no problems. We like being on the safe side so we went to the immigration house in Victoria, filled in some forms and our stay was extended. Because our flight on the way back was only two days from when we came there they didn’t take our passports but the officer mentioned the otherwise they would have taken the passports and asked us to come within few days to pick them up.

# Car Rental

We heard it was hard to take taxies around the island and from a quick check the taxis are rather pricy. On the other hand the gas and renting a car are pretty cheap so we rented a car.
Tip: there are some local rental companies that are much less expensive and they even bring you the car to your hotel. We paid 25 euros per day in the local company in comparison to ??

They drive on the left side and Mahe Island is pretty hard to drive, it has a lot of ups and downs, narrow paths, running water and rain, people are driving crazily fast, and if that’s not enough buses also drive there and always seem like they are about to crush into you.

# Scary Animals

The natives say there aren't any venomous animals on the island. There are snakes but they are not dangerous, there are no other big scary animals. On the other hand, there are the centipedes. Oh the Centipedes. How big and scary they are. They are venomous and their bite hurts as hell, I even heard of some stories of people losing their eyesight for some time when bitten, and that it hurts for days. So I'll pass the same advice I got forward - “if you see a centipede - you walk the other way”.
The beaches also has many crabs on the beach, you will see a lot of holes with different sizes which host different sizes of crabs. They looked scary to me, but they are harmless and do not bite so don’t worry.
There are also some big spiders and a lot of bats perfectly shaped you will see them in the sky a lot. Oh and there are geckos. And if you are unfamiliar with those as we were - their sound would surprise you!
Other than that and the centipedes don’t worry.
